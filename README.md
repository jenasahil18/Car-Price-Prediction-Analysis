#🚗 Car Price Prediction Analysis
A machine learning project focused on predicting car prices using various regression algorithms. This analysis leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation techniques to provide accurate price predictions based on car features.

📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop and compare multiple regression models that predict the selling price of a car based on features like brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission, and more. This helps buyers and sellers estimate a fair market value.

🧠 Machine Learning Model was use Linear Regression

📂 Dataset
